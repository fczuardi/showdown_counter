# polishing
- smaller Pompiere font-set
- replace png icons with svg
- animation for counter deletion
- cleanup the background of the footer logo, make it a sprite for few requests

# new-counter
- investigate if we still want "pull to add"

# Firefox Marketplace
- circle icons for FirefoxOS?
- translate manifest fields for Portuguese (Firefox Marketplace)

# appstores

# refactor
- use the defaults.json data to create the first counterset instead of going to the DOM

# contributors
- include built folder in the repository to make easier for people to
    contribute without having to have the build system
